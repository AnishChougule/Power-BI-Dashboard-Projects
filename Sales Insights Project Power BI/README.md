# Sales Insights Project Power BI

In this project, I developed a Power BI dashboard that provides sales insights and profit analysis by cities and customers. The main objective of the dashboard was to identify profitable customers and cities while highlighting areas where the company is losing money.

The data was sourced from a MySQL database, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extract, transform, and load (ETL) were done using SQL. The data was then cleaned and transformed using Power Query, and data modeling was carried out to create relationships between tables in the database.

Using DAX, I created measures that provided a comprehensive view of sales insights and profit analysis. The dashboard displays the profitability of each customer and city, allowing for quick assessment of which customers and cities are profitable and which ones are not. The dashboard also shows the quantity of orders and products sold, enabling the team to understand sales trends and patterns.

The dashboard provides insights on a yearly and monthly basis, allowing the team to track progress over time and make data-driven decisions. I also ensured that the dashboard followed good design principles, making it easy to understand and navigate.
